# C++ Course (C++23)

This repository contains coursework, exercises, and practice programs
written in **C++23**.

The goal of this repo is to build a strong foundation in modern C++,
with an emphasis on correctness, performance, and idiomatic use of the
language.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to C++: history, core concepts, and language overview
- Object-based and object-oriented programming
- Operator overloading
- References, copy semantics, and move semantics
- Pointers and iterators
- Algorithms and containers
- Ranges and views
- Templates and concepts
- Hashing
- Standard library facilities: `<tuple>`, `<variant>`, `<random>`
- Concurrency programming
- Memory management: `<memory>` and `<atomic>`
- Emerging and upcoming standard features (e.g., C++26 additions)
- Advanced memory utilities: `<memory_resource>`
- Multidimensional data views: `<mdspan>`
- Debugging and diagnostics utilities: `<source_location>`, `<stacktrace>`
- Additional modern C++ standard library facilities

Compile and run command: g++ -std=c++23 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic main.cpp -o main && ./main
